# Buck Mason Stylist Skill

A personal-shopping skill for [Buck Mason](https://www.buckmason.com), built for Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT custom GPTs, and any agent that loads `SKILL.md`–style skills. Talks to the pima.io MCP at `pima.io/mcp/buckmason/*`.

## What it does

- **Stock check** — "do they have the [item] in my size, online and at the Abbot Kinney store?" — returns bucketed live counts (`In stock` / `Low stock (N left)` / `Out of stock`) per location.
- **Wardrobe gap analysis** — "what am I missing for a Sonoma wedding in May?" — diffs your owned items against a season + climate + dress-code-aware capsule recommendation, with a one-sentence "why" per pick.
- **AI try-on lookbooks** — generate editorial photos of you wearing the recommended outfits using OpenAI image-gen, with garment-level fidelity (color, fabric weight, silhouette) and identity preservation from your reference photos.
- **One-shot cart + checkout** — default: stateless `POST /mcp/buckmason/cart` returns a Shopify permalink the customer pays in their browser. For fully agent-driven purchases (no browser), `POST /mcp/buckmason/checkout` speaks the [Merchant Payments Protocol](https://mpp.dev) — HTTP 402 + Stripe Shared Payment Token via [`stripe/link-cli`](https://github.com/stripe/link-cli), push-approved by the customer in the Link app. See `references/mpp.md`.

## Required setup

### `OPENAI_API_KEY` (only for the AI try-on lookbook workflow)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

The skill posts to `https://api.openai.com/v1/images/edits` with `model: "gpt-image-2"` to generate editorial try-on images. **The OpenAI organization tied to the key must be verified for `gpt-image-2`** (see <https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10910291>). Get a key at <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>.

The other workflows — stock check, recommend, cart, checkout, order tracking — do **not** require an OpenAI key. They only call the pima.io MCP.

### Profile

One profile file in your agent's workspace (copy from `templates/profile.example.md`):

```bash
cp templates/profile.example.md ~/agent-workspace/profile.md
$EDITOR ~/agent-workspace/profile.md   # fill in sizes, home zip, build, face, reference photos
```

That's it. No Buck Mason credentials. No Pima account.

Optional but useful:
- `wardrobe.md` — owned items (enables gap analysis)
- `events.md` — upcoming travel/events (enables event-aware suggestions)
- `magick`, `python-pptx`, `Pillow` — only needed for the editorial PPT/HTML lookbook output (see `references/output-formats.md`)
- [`stripe/link-cli`](https://github.com/stripe/link-cli) — only needed for the MPP fully-agent-driven checkout path

## Install via ClawHub

Listing: <https://clawhub.ai/nickmerwin/buck-mason-stylist-skill>

```bash
clawhub install nickmerwin/buck-mason-stylist-skill

# Some ClawHub install paths strip the executable bit on unpack — restore it
# once after installing so the bundled scripts can run directly. (The skill's
# own command examples all use explicit `bash` / `python3` prefixes that
# work regardless, so this step is optional but tidier.)
chmod +x ~/.clawhub/skills/buck-mason-stylist-skill/scripts/*

This skill is Buck Mason / Pima.io–specific by design. The MCP endpoints, brand voice, store footprint, and product taxonomy are all Buck Mason. Forks for other brands are welcome — replace the `/mcp/buckmason/...` paths with your own tenant slug, swap the references, and you're most of the way there.
